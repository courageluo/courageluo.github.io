                    1. Introduction<br>
                    Prior to mating, animals advertise and evaluate an array of often conspicuous visual, acoustic and chemical sexual signals [1,2]. These pre-mating sexual signals offer the choosing sex (typically females) the opportunity to assess the quality and genetic compatibility of potential mates [1–4]. After mating, communication between the sexes continues but is restricted to chemosensory communication between gametes and, in the case of internal fertilizers, the female reproductive tract [5]. Such post-mating chemosensory communication between eggs and sperm can facilitate gamete-mediated mate choice, allowing eggs to exert cryptic female choice and bias fertilizations towards specific males [6,7]. However, our understanding of the potential for gamete-mediated mate choice remains limited in internally fertilizing species, and is completely unexplored in humans.
                    Sperm chemoattraction, a remote form of chemical communication between eggs and sperm occurring before gamete contact, is a widespread mechanism for increasing sperm density around unfertilized eggs in animals [5]. In broadcast spawning marine invertebrates, where adults are unable to express pre-ejaculatory mate choice, chemoattractants increase fertilization rates by increasing the effective target size of the egg, maintain species barriers by preferentially recruiting conspecific sperm, and allow sperm and eggs to exercise gamete-mediated mate choice [6–9]. Chemoattractants in marine invertebrates can also preferentially recruit sperm from specific, presumably more compatible males by remotely altering sperm swimming physiology and behaviour, thereby increasing fertilization rates, embryo viability and offspring survival [7]. In internally fertilizing species, females can exercise cryptic female choice through interactions between sperm and the female reproductive tract, influencing the number of sperm a female retains and/or sperm swimming performance [10,11]. Subsequent interactions between eggs and sperm can also facilitate gamete-mediated mate choice in internal fertilizers. For example, in house mice (Mus domesticus) Firman & Simmons [12] found that eggs were preferentially fertilized by sperm from less related males during in vitro fertilizations (IVF), and suggested that either direct interactions among cell-surface proteins on gametes or differential responses to chemoattractants could explain these effects. In mammalian reproduction, chemoattraction is the last of a series of sperm guidance mechanisms (including positive rheotaxis and thermotaxis) that acts to recruit capacitated sperm to eggs [5,13]. By contrast with marine invertebrates, mammalian sperm lack species-specificity in responses to chemoattractants [14], suggesting that pre-mating species recognition mechanisms may reduce the need for post-mating processes to reinforce species barriers. Nevertheless, mammalian chemoattractants could play a post-mating role in gamete-mediated mate choice, either to maximize genomic compatibility between potential mates [3,4] or to reinforce or override pre-mating mate choice decisions [11,15]. However, the potential for chemoattractants to serve a sexually selected role in human reproduction remains unexplored.
                    Here, we assess if follicular fluid, a source of sperm chemoattractants [16], differentially regulates sperm behaviour to reinforce pre-mating mate choice decisions and mediate fertilization success in humans. Human sperm respond to chemoattractants present in the follicular fluid surrounding eggs (most likely progesterone [5], although this remains a source of ongoing debate) by altering their swimming behaviour to orient towards, and accumulate in, follicular fluid [16]. Sperm behavioural responses can differ among follicular fluids, such that follicular fluids from different females exhibit variation in their ability to attract sperm from the same male [16]. Moreover, females producing follicular fluid that was better at causing an accumulation response in sperm also produce eggs that achieved higher fertilization rates in clinical IVF cycles [16]. Thus, differential responses in sperm behaviour to follicular fluid have the potential to facilitate gamete-mediated mate choice in humans. We investigated this potential using two distinct experimental designs, exposing sperm to follicular fluid from two females either simultaneously or non-simultaneously, and report robust evidence that sperm accumulation is influenced by the interactive effects between males and females.

                    2. Material and methods<br>
                    (a) Sample acquisition and clinical data
                    We obtained follicular fluid and sperm samples from couples undergoing assisted reproductive treatment (IVF; intracytoplasmic sperm injection, ICSI) at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, UK, with written informed patient consent and approval from Central Manchester Research Ethics Committee (electronic supplementary material). We specifically focused on couples receiving assisted reproductive treatment, rather than, for example, performing assays using sperm from males not seeking fertility treatment, as one of our aims was to investigate the link between partner choice and gametic interactions. Samples were obtained using standard clinical practices [17] (see electronic supplementary material). All data were collected blind to the treatments and patient identity to ensure that patient confidentiality was maintained to comply with the WHO Good Clinical Research Practice guidelines [18] and the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority Code of Practice [19], and also ensure that the researcher was blinded from identifying which samples originated from each couple during the experiment.
                    Information relating to the participant's fertility procedure was collected, including the type of fertilization method used (IVF or ICSI), number of oocytes retrieved, number of oocytes successfully fertilized, embryo quality score, pregnancy outcome and live birth success. For couples undergoing IVF, fertilization success was calculated as the number of fertilized embryos divided by the number of oocytes retrieved and inseminated, while for couples undergoing ICSI, fertilization success was calculated as the number of fertilized embryos divided by the number of oocytes injected. Embryo quality was determined using an embryology morphology grading scheme (see electronic supplementary material). Pregnancy outcome was scored based on evidence of implanted embryos, while live births were treated as successful outcomes relative to all other outcomes (see electronic supplementary material). Ejaculate traits differ between patients being treated with IVF or ICSI; for example, sperm density is lower in ICSI than IVF patients in the non-simultaneous choice experiment (see below) (linear mixed model, LMM: χ2 = 5.2, p = 0.02). Therefore, we were cautious in how we analysed data from these two treatment groups. However, our experimental design excluded males with severe male factor infertility, as such males would not have sufficient sperm to be used in the experimental assays (i.e. males undergoing ICSI were diagnosed with either male factor subfertility or were normospermic men who suffered poor fertilization with IVF in a previous cycle). Data analyses examined the impact of including ICSI patients in statistical models either by removing these patients or including the type of fertility treatment as a fixed effect in the model (described below).
                    (b) Experimental overview
                    To test if follicular fluid influences sperm behaviour, we adapted a classic dichotomous mate choice assay to the microscopic scale (i.e. simultaneous presentation of two stimuli; figure 1). We performed two experiments using a North Carolina II cross-classified block design [20]. This experimental design facilitated the examination of female, male and female–male interacting effects on sperm behaviour in follicular fluid. Each experimental block comprised the follicular fluid and sperm samples from a unique set of two couples, exposing sperm from each male to follicular fluid from their partner and a non-partner (figure 1a,b). We performed two cross-classified experiments that differed in how sperm experienced the choice of follicular fluid from different females, being either ‘simultaneous' or ‘non-simultaneous' (figure 1c,d). Sperm responsiveness to follicular fluid was quantified by counting the number of sperm accumulating in the follicular fluid from each female. Each assay was replicated twice and repeatability among experimental replicates was high (simultaneous choice experiment: R = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.92–0.98, p < 0.001; non-simultaneous choice experiment: R = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95–0.98, p < 0.001, see electronic supplementary material). High repeatability is consistent with a chemotactic response rather than mechanical trapping effects, where sperm accumulate due to adsorption to the experimental apparatus, which is unlikely to exhibit high repeatability between experimental replicates [21].

                    3. Results<br>
                    When sperm were presented with a simultaneous choice of swimming towards follicular fluids from two females (a partner and a non-partner, n = 16 couples, eight blocks of factorial crosses; figure 1c), sperm accumulation in follicular fluid was significantly influenced by the interactive effect of female–male identity (F8,32 = 19.38, p < 0.001; figure 2a, table 1a). However, in internally fertilizing species such as humans, sperm are never presented with the simultaneous choice of follicular fluid from more than one female. Therefore, we performed a second cross-classified experiment under biologically relevant conditions, where sperm were non-simultaneously exposed to follicular fluid from two females (n = 44 couples, 22 blocks of factorial crosses; figure 1d). In the non-simultaneous choice experiment, sperm were given the choice between the follicular fluid from one female (either the partner or non-partner) and a control solution (sperm preparation medium). When sperm were presented with the non-simultaneous choice of follicular fluid, sperm responsiveness was also influenced by the interaction between female and male identity (F22,88 = 21.82, p < 0.001; figure 2b, table 1b). The significant interactive effects of female–male identity on sperm behaviour remained when we examined IVF and ICSI patients separately in the simultaneous and non-simultaneous choice experiments (electronic supplementary material, table S1).
